### Migration

To update your SanitizeProcessor initialization to use explicit sensitive keys:

```typescript
const processor = new SanitizeProcessor({
  sensitiveKeys: [
    "password",
    "token",
    /secret.*/i,
    // ... add your sensitive patterns
  ],
});
```

To migrate from legacy GUITransport methods to the new state management system:

```typescript
// Before
const transport = new GUITransport();
transport.onUpdate((entries) => {
  console.log("Entries updated:", entries);
});
transport.setFilter("namespace", true);
const entries = transport.getEntries();

// After
const transport = new GUITransport({
  maxEntries: 1000,
  defaultFilters: { namespace: true },
});
transport.onStateUpdate((state) => {
  console.log("State updated:", {
    entries: state.entries,
    filters: state.filters,
  });
});
```
