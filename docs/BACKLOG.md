## Log Level Type Normalization

**Priority:** P0 ✅ COMPLETED in v0.1.4a
**Type:** Enhancement
**Component:** Core/Types
**Found:** During POC NOW nav implementation
**Reporter:** Claude/Ian

### Problem Statement
The current type system for log levels enforces uppercase strings (e.g., 'DEBUG') while JavaScript/TypeScript conventions typically favor lowercase for such constants. This creates friction in the developer experience and doesn't align with common patterns.

### Current Behavior
```typescript
const debug = createJitterbug({
    level: 'debug' // Now supported! Both 'debug' and 'DEBUG' work
});
```

### Impact
- ✅ Developers can now use lowercase (matches common patterns)
- ✅ Matches common logging patterns in other libraries
- ✅ Eliminates unnecessary type errors
- ✅ Improves DX and adoption potential

### Solution Implemented
1. Accept both cases:
```typescript
type LogLevel = keyof typeof LogLevels | Lowercase<keyof typeof LogLevels>;
```

2. Normalize internally:
```typescript
function normalizeLogLevel(level: LogLevel): StandardLogLevel {
    return level.toUpperCase() as StandardLogLevel;
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Added deprecation warning for uppercase in future major version
- ✅ Updated documentation to show lowercase as preferred
- ✅ Added tests for both cases

### Validation
- [x] Type system accepts both cases
- [x] Runtime behavior identical regardless of case
- [x] No breaking changes for existing implementations
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Tests added

### References
- POC NOW nav implementation where issue was discovered
- Common logging libraries (Winston, Pino, etc.) for conventions

## Type System Improvements

**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Enhancement
**Component:** Core/Types
**Found:** During log level normalization implementation
**Reporter:** Claude/Ian

### Problem Statement
The current type system has some areas that could benefit from stronger type safety and better error handling, particularly around asynchronous operations and promise handling.

### Current Behavior
```typescript
// Some type conflicts between modules
// Inconsistent Promise handling
// Import cycles causing type mismatches
```

### Impact
- Type conflicts can lead to runtime errors
- Promise handling could be more robust
- Import cycles make type definitions harder to maintain
- Debugging experience could be improved

### Proposed Solution
1. Enhance Promise handling:
```typescript
// Standardize on async/await
async function processAndWrite(): Promise<void> {
  const processed = await processLog();
  await writeLog(processed);
}
```

2. Improve type organization:
```typescript
// Consolidate related types
// Prevent import cycles
// Better error type propagation
```

3. Add debugging utilities:
```typescript
// Type-safe error boundaries
// Better stack trace handling
// Enhanced debugging context
```

### Implementation Notes
- Should maintain backward compatibility
- Consider performance implications
- Add comprehensive type tests
- Document type patterns

### Validation Required
- [ ] Type system accepts all valid use cases
- [ ] Runtime behavior matches type definitions
- [ ] No breaking changes for existing code
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests added for type edge cases
