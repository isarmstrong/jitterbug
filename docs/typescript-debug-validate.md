# Four-Part System Overview

This document provides an overview of the four-pool system (Pools A through D). These pools work in tandem to handle different segments of functionality or data within the overall architecture.

## Pool A
• Responsible for preliminary data ingestion and basic validation.  
• Acts as the first layer of buffering before data moves downstream.  

## Pool B
• Handles the enriched or partially transformed data from Pool A.  
• Applies domain-specific transformations or validations.  

## Pool C
• Receives data from Pool B after domain processing.  
• Often focuses on cross-referencing or merging data from integrated sources.  

## Pool D
• Final gateway or output stage of the pipeline.  
• May be responsible for exports, external API calls, or final storage.

**Key Points for Each Pool:**
1. They are designed to be modular yet chained.  
2. A typical data record traverses A → B → C → D in sequence.  
3. Each pool can run independently if needed (local testing, partial runs, etc.).  
4. Logging or diagnostics can be performed at each stage to troubleshoot issues.

## Additional Considerations
• Ensure consistent typing and interfaces across the entire pool structure.  
• Configure strict TypeScript checks to reduce errors and ensure correctness.  
• Consider writing integration tests that span from Pool A to Pool D to validate the entire pipeline.
