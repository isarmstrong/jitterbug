## Priority Lint Backlog

### A. Module Resolution Issues (0 remaining)
✅ Fixed require statement in SSE factory transport

  ✅ Fixed unused variables in version.ts

## Recently Completed

- ✅ Edge Boundary Layer (EBL)
  - Implemented validation strategies
  - Added memory management with WeakMap
  - Added runtime guards
  - Implemented hydration checks

- ✅ Core Type Foundation (A1)
  - Refactored and organized core type definitions
  - Verified integration across packages
  - Build restored and stable

- ✅ Core Transport Layer
  - Added basic SSE implementation
  - Implemented rate limiting
  - Added backpressure handling
  - Added basic error reporting

## In Progress

### Critical Path (This Week)
1. Type Safety Improvements (Pool B)
   - [ ] Fix explicit "any" types (14 instances)
   - [ ] Fix unused type parameters (3 instances)
   - [ ] Fix unused variables (6 instances)

2. System Configuration (Pool D)
   - [ ] Code style updates (6 instances)

### Next Steps
- Environment-aware transport selection
  - Localhost: Console transport with full debug output
  - Staging: Client-side transport for server messages
  - Production: Sentry integration for critical paths

### Transport Implementation
1. Console Transport (P0)
   - Full debug output in development
   - Memory usage warnings
   - Type validation errors
   - Runtime detection logs

2. Client Transport (P1)
   - Server message forwarding
   - Basic UI for server logs
   - Simple filtering options
   - Keep Edge runtime constraints

3. Sentry Transport (P2)
   - Critical error reporting
   - Memory threshold alerts
   - Basic breadcrumbs
   - Context preservation

## Future Scope (Post-Integration)
- Advanced Sentry Integration
  - Performance monitoring
  - Error correlation
  - Custom context injection
- GUI Transport & Analytics
- LLM Integration

## Maintenance Guidelines
- Keep Edge runtime constraints in mind
- Maintain type safety across boundaries
- Document memory management decisions
- Test in actual Edge environment

## Legacy Lint Backlog Integration

### Summary of Recent Improvements
- Updated ambient module declarations in `src/types/jitterbug-modules.d.ts` to provide proper type and value exports using classes for LogTransport and ConsoleTransport, and exporting LogLevels, Environment, Runtime, and ValidationResult with required properties.
- Added runtime implementations and stubs in `packages/jitterbug/src/index.ts` so that imports for `@jitterbug` resolve to concrete values.
- Updated the `ValidationResult` interface (and `ExtendedValidationResult` type) to include `isValid` and `errors`, addressing errors in SSE transport files.
- Refined `

## Core Stabilization Plan

The core type definitions (src/types/core.ts) are in a transitional state. To bring them to a final, production-ready state and establish a single source of truth, we plan to address the following tasks:

- [ ] **Resolve Naming Conflicts:**
  - Identify and eliminate duplicate definitions, particularly for common type aliases like LogEntry and LogTransport.
  - Consolidate these exports into a single canonical definition that will be used across the codebase.

- [ ] **Consolidate Core Type Definitions:**
  - Ensure that all core types (constants, base interfaces, and utility interfaces) are defined and exported in one place.
  - Update dependent modules and packages to refer to these consolidated types.

- [ ] **Update Documentation and Comments:**
  - Clearly document the design decisions behind using Object.freeze for immutable constants and the separation of base types vs. core interfaces.
  - Include guidelines on how new types should be added to the core in order to maintain consistency with the TypeScript Design Philosophy.

- [ ] **Improve Memory Management Integration:**
  - Review and enhance any memory management hooks (e.g., cleanup functions) to ensure they align with our Edge-first, memory-conscious design.
  - Add comments/examples for using these hooks effectively.

- [ ] **Expand and Strengthen Tests:**
  - Create or update tests specifically targeting the core type definitions and interfaces.
  - Verify that changes do not break integration with packages like jitterbug-next, jitterbug-types, and jitterbug-core-types.

- [ ] **Finalize TSConfig and Lint Configurations:**
  - Review TSConfig paths and ESLint settings to ensure the core is correctly included and lint errors are minimized.
  - Address any lingering configurations that might contribute to confusion in the module resolution.

This plan will be tracked as part of our backlog items and should be completed in upcoming iterations to truly establish the core as our single source of truth for type definitions.
