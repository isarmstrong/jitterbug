# Jitterbug Backlog

## Priority Lint Backlog

### A. Module Resolution Issues (0 remaining)
✅ Fixed require statement in SSE factory transport

### B. Type Safety Issues (0 remaining)
✅ Fixed explicit "any" types (14 instances)
✅ Fixed unused type parameters (3 instances)
✅ Fixed unused variables (6 instances)

### C. Component Type Safety Issues (0 remaining)
✅ Fixed SSE escape characters in Next 13 and 14 implementations

### D. System Configuration and Project Structure (0 remaining)
✅ Updated code style and best practices:
  ✅ Replaced var with let/const in cache.ts
  ✅ Fixed const usage in handlers.ts
  ✅ Fixed unused variables in logger.ts
  ✅ Fixed unused variables in edge.ts
  ✅ Fixed unused variables in hydration.ts
  ✅ Fixed unused variables in version.ts

## Recently Completed

- ✅ Edge Boundary Layer (EBL)
  - Implemented validation strategies
  - Added memory management with WeakMap
  - Added runtime guards
  - Implemented hydration checks

- ✅ Core Type Foundation (A1)
  - Refactored and organized core type definitions
  - Verified integration across packages
  - Build restored and stable

- ✅ Core Transport Layer
  - Added basic SSE implementation
  - Implemented rate limiting
  - Added backpressure handling
  - Added basic error reporting

## In Progress

### Critical Path (This Week)
1. Type Safety Improvements (Pool B)
   - [ ] Fix explicit "any" types (14 instances)
   - [ ] Fix unused type parameters (3 instances)
   - [ ] Fix unused variables (6 instances)

2. System Configuration (Pool D)
   - [ ] Code style updates (6 instances)

### Next Steps
- Environment-aware transport selection
  - Localhost: Console transport with full debug output
  - Staging: Client-side transport for server messages
  - Production: Sentry integration for critical paths

### Transport Implementation
1. Console Transport (P0)
   - Full debug output in development
   - Memory usage warnings
   - Type validation errors
   - Runtime detection logs

2. Client Transport (P1)
   - Server message forwarding
   - Basic UI for server logs
   - Simple filtering options
   - Keep Edge runtime constraints

3. Sentry Transport (P2)
   - Critical error reporting
   - Memory threshold alerts
   - Basic breadcrumbs
   - Context preservation

## Future Scope (Post-Integration)
- Advanced Sentry Integration
  - Performance monitoring
  - Error correlation
  - Custom context injection
- GUI Transport & Analytics
- LLM Integration

## Maintenance Guidelines
- Keep Edge runtime constraints in mind
- Maintain type safety across boundaries
- Document memory management decisions
- Test in actual Edge environment

## Legacy Lint Backlog Integration

### Summary of Recent Improvements
- Updated ambient module declarations in `src/types/jitterbug-modules.d.ts` to provide proper type and value exports using classes for LogTransport and ConsoleTransport, and exporting LogLevels, Environment, Runtime, and ValidationResult with required properties.
- Added runtime implementations and stubs in `packages/jitterbug/src/index.ts` so that imports for `@jitterbug` resolve to concrete values.
- Updated the `ValidationResult` interface (and `ExtendedValidationResult` type) to include `isValid` and `errors`, addressing errors in SSE transport files.
- Refined `
