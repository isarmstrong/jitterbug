# SSE Implementation Analysis - 2024-01-27 20:45

## Current State
- Using Edge Runtime with Next.js 15.1.6
- SSE implementation with ReadableStream
- Enhanced connection tracking with Map<string, ConnectionInfo>
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism (5 attempts with jitter)
- Memory monitoring and cleanup

## Latest Improvements

1. Connection State Management
   ```typescript
   type ConnectionState = 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'failed';
   type ConnectionInfo = {
       controller: ReadableStreamDefaultController;
       state: ConnectionState;
       lastHeartbeat: number;
       retryCount: number;
       heapUsage: number;
   };
   ```

2. Memory Management
   - Added heap usage monitoring via `performance.memory`
   - Implemented connection cleanup for stale/memory-heavy connections
   - Configurable memory limits (100MB default)

3. Enhanced Retry Logic
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Maximum backoff delay of 32 seconds
   - Increased max retries to 5 attempts
   - Proper state tracking during reconnection

4. Connection Pooling
   - Implemented proper connection pool with Map
   - Added connection state machine
   - Automatic cleanup of stale connections
   - Heartbeat monitoring

## Client Implementation

1. EventSource Hook (`useEventSource`)
   - Robust connection management
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Heartbeat monitoring and timeout detection
   - Connection state tracking and error handling
   - Event type differentiation (heartbeat, connected, custom)

2. LogStream Component
   - Real-time log display with auto-scrolling
   - Connection status indicator
   - Error display
   - Log level-based styling
   - Context expansion for detailed logs
   - Limited to last 100 logs for performance

## Configuration
```typescript
const CONFIG = {
    INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY: 1000,
    MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 5,
    HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 30000,
    MAX_BACKOFF_DELAY: 32000,
    CLEANUP_INTERVAL: 60000,
    MAX_HEAP_USAGE: 100 * 1024 * 1024,
    CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 35000,
};
```

## Next Steps
1. Add connection statistics and monitoring
2. Implement server-side event buffering
3. Add client-side log filtering
4. Implement log search functionality
5. Add log export capabilities
