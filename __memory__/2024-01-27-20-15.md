# Jitterbug Development Context
Last Updated: 2024-01-27 20:15 UTC

## Latest Status
✅ Fixed: 405 Method Not Allowed errors resolved by implementing proper health check handlers
✅ Fixed: SSE transport implementation for Next.js 15 using EventSource
✅ Fixed: Access modifiers in base and Next.js 15 SSE transports
✅ Fixed: Version detection and logging
✅ Fixed: Type safety for log entries
✅ Fixed: OPTIONS handler signature mismatch in route.ts
❌ New Issue: SSE transport not connecting to client console

## Current Understanding
- Route handler is properly configured with correct method signatures
- OPTIONS method now correctly takes no parameters (matches LogHandlerResponse type)
- SSE transports (13, 14, 15) have consistent implementations:
  - Next.js 13/14: Uses fetch + ReadableStream
  - Next.js 15: Uses EventSource
- Version detection is working through NextVersionProvider
- All transports use proper access modifiers and type safety

## Implementation Notes
1. Route Handler:
   - GET/POST: Require request parameter
   - HEAD/OPTIONS: Take no parameters
   - All methods properly typed with NextRequest
   - Proper CORS headers for SSE support

2. SSE Transports:
   - Base transport provides common functionality
   - Version-specific implementations handle connection differently
   - Consistent error handling and logging
   - Proper cleanup on disconnect

## Next Steps
1. Debug SSE connection issues:
   - Add verbose logging for stream initialization
   - Monitor client-side EventSource events
   - Verify CORS headers in browser
2. Consider implementing:
   - Message buffering during reconnection
   - Connection health metrics
   - Automatic reconnection logic

## Environment Context
- Next.js: 15.1.6
- Node.js: 22
- React: 18.2.0
- Runtime: Edge

## Recent Changes Timeline
1. Fixed route handler method signatures
2. Implemented consistent transport error handling
3. Added proper type safety for log entries
4. Updated version detection logging
5. Fixed access modifiers across transports

## Long-term Improvements
1. Expose connection metrics for monitoring
2. Add support for custom serialization
3. Consider implementing backpressure handling
4. Add support for binary message formats
