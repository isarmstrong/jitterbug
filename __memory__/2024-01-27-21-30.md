## Current State
- React hooks ordering issues resolved in `useEventSource.ts`
- Logger initialization is async with proper client ID handling
- SSE connection attempts showing a pattern of double client ID in URL

## Root Cause Analysis
Looking at the error pattern:
```
GET /api/logs/1738011784852-mjitahme6n/1738011784852-mjitahme6n 404
```
The client ID is being appended twice to the URL because:

1. In `LogStreamContent`, we're constructing the URL with client ID:
```typescript
const url = `${window.location.origin}/api/logs/${clientId}`
```

2. Then in `useEventSource`, we're appending it again:
```typescript
urlWithParams.pathname = `${basePath}/${clientIdRef.current}`;
```

## Evolution of the Issue
1. Started with async initialization issues
2. Fixed logger to handle async client ID
3. Fixed React hooks ordering
4. But introduced URL construction redundancy

## Required Changes
1. In `LogStreamContent`:
   - Should pass base URL only: `/api/logs`
   - Let `useEventSource` handle client ID appending

2. In `useEventSource`:
   - Keep current client ID handling
   - URL construction is correct here

## Critical Dependencies
- Client ID generation in `logger.ts`
- URL construction in `useEventSource.ts`
- Base URL handling in `LogStream.tsx`

## Next Steps
1. Update `LogStreamContent` to use base URL only
2. Verify URL construction in `useEventSource`
3. Add URL construction logging
4. Consider adding URL validation
