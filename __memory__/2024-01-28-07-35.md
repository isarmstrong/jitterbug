# Memory Entry: 2024-01-28-07-35

## Current State
1. Basic logger implementation working across browsers
2. Direct console output with proper formatting
3. Clean error handling and stack traces
4. Simple client ID generation
5. Basic SSE connection (404 expected without endpoint)

## What We Removed
1. React Version-Specific Code
   - Removed React 18/19 detection
   - Removed version-specific hooks
   - Removed transition handling

2. Complex State Management
   - Removed multiple state types
   - Removed async state updates
   - Removed complex retry logic

3. Transport Layer Complexity
   - Removed multiple transport options
   - Removed handler configurations
   - Removed complex URL construction

4. Async Patterns
   - Removed async initialization
   - Removed promise-based client ID
   - Removed complex error retry logic

5. Console Output Complexity
   - Removed console grouping
   - Removed styled console output
   - Removed complex data formatting

## What Works Now
1. Simple, direct console logging
2. Consistent cross-browser behavior
3. Clear error messages and stack traces
4. Basic SSE connection handling
5. Simple client ID persistence
6. Clear log formatting with timestamps

## Worth Adding Back Incrementally

### 1. Error Handling (High Priority)
- Retry logic for SSE connections
- Backoff strategy for reconnections
- Better error categorization

### 2. Console Enhancements (Medium Priority)
- Optional console grouping
- Configurable styling (if needed)
- Log level filtering

### 3. Transport Features (Medium Priority)
- Multiple transport options
- Configurable endpoints
- Message batching

### 4. State Management (Low Priority)
- Message history limits
- State persistence
- Connection state recovery

### 5. Development Features (Low Priority)
- Debug mode toggles
- Performance tracking
- Log export/import

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with error handling improvements
2. Add console enhancements one at a time
3. Add transport features as needed
4. Consider state management last

## Notes
- Keep each feature optional
- Maintain the current simplicity as base
- Add complexity only when justified
- Keep cross-browser compatibility
- Document each addition clearly 

# 2024-01-28 07:35 - Fixed SSE Connection Issues

## Issues
1. After adding back error handling, the test project was experiencing infinite 404 errors
2. Dynamic route params were not being properly handled in Next.js 15
3. SSE connections were reconnecting too aggressively

## Root Causes
1. The route structure was incorrect for Next.js 15's dynamic route handling
2. Dynamic params needed to be properly awaited in Next.js 15 (must await entire params object)
3. No connection state tracking or retry limits for SSE connections

## Changes Made
1. Moved route from `/api/logs/route.ts` to `/api/logs/[clientId]/route.ts`
2. Updated dynamic params handling to await entire params object:
   ```typescript
   const resolvedParams = await params;
   const clientId = resolvedParams.clientId;
   ```
3. Added connection state tracking to prevent duplicate connections
4. Implemented proper reconnection strategy with:
   - Maximum retry limit (3 attempts)
   - Fixed delay between retries (5 seconds)
   - Connection state cleanup
   - Proper error handling

## Key Learnings
1. Next.js 15 requires proper dynamic route structure with `[param]` in folder name
2. Dynamic params in Next.js 15 Edge routes must be handled by:
   - Awaiting the entire params object first
   - Then accessing properties from the resolved object
   - Cannot await individual properties directly
3. SSE connections need:
   - State tracking to prevent duplicates
   - Controlled retry strategy
   - Proper cleanup on unmount
   - Error state management

## Type Information
```typescript
type EventSourceStatus = 'CONNECTING' | 'OPEN' | 'CLOSED' | 'ERROR';

type ConnectionState = 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'failed';
type ConnectionInfo = {
    controller: ReadableStreamDefaultController;
    state: ConnectionState;
    lastHeartbeat: number;
    retryCount: number;
    heapUsage: number;
};
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor connection stability with new retry strategy
2. Consider adding connection pooling if needed
3. Add telemetry for connection lifecycle events
4. Consider implementing server-side heartbeat detection
