## Jitterbug Development Context
Last Updated: 2024-01-27 20:00 UTC

### Latest Status
✅ Fixed: SSE transport implementation for Next.js 15
✅ Fixed: Access modifiers in base and Next.js 15 SSE transports
✅ Fixed: Version detection and logging
✅ Fixed: Type safety for log entries

### Current Understanding
1. SSE Transport Architecture:
   - Base SSE transport provides common functionality and protected access methods
   - Next.js 15 transport extends base with version-specific implementation
   - Version detection is handled by the version provider
   - Log entries use the LogType interface from types.ts

2. Working Components:
   - Version detection and validation
   - SSE connection establishment
   - Log writing with proper headers
   - Connection state management
   - Clean disconnection handling

3. Implementation Notes:
   - Base SSE transport:
     - Protected access to connection state and EventSource
     - Common header generation
     - Stream timeout handling
     - End-of-stream event creation

   - Next.js 15 SSE transport:
     - Uses EventSource for SSE connections
     - Proper error handling and logging
     - Version validation on initialization
     - Clean state management through base class methods

### Next Steps
1. Implement message buffering for disconnected state
2. Add reconnection logic with backoff
3. Consider adding metrics for connection health
4. Add tests for version-specific behaviors

### Environment Context
- Next.js: 15.1.6
- Node.js: 22
- React: 18.2.0
- Runtime: Edge

### Recent Changes Timeline
1. Created version provider for Next.js version detection
2. Implemented base SSE transport with protected access methods
3. Created Next.js 15 SSE transport with version-specific implementation
4. Fixed access modifiers and type safety issues
5. Added proper error handling and logging

### Long-term Improvements
1. Consider exposing connection metrics
2. Add support for custom serialization
3. Implement message compression
4. Add support for binary message formats
5. Consider adding connection pooling for high-volume scenarios
