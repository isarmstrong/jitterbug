# Jitterbug Development Context
Last Updated: 2024-01-27 20:30 UTC

## Latest Status
✅ Fixed: 405 Method Not Allowed errors resolved by implementing proper health check handlers
✅ Fixed: SSE transport implementation for Next.js 15 using EventSource
✅ Fixed: Access modifiers in base and Next.js 15 SSE transports
✅ Fixed: Version detection and logging
✅ Fixed: Type safety for log entries
✅ Fixed: OPTIONS handler signature mismatch in route.ts
❌ Issue: Missing transport path confirmation in logs
❌ Issue: SSE transport not connecting to client console

## Current Understanding
From the logs:
1. Route handler is receiving and processing SSE requests:
   ```
   [Jitterbug Route] SSE connection requested
   [Jitterbug Route] Creating SSE stream
   [Jitterbug Route] SSE stream started
   ```
2. Logs are being received and processed:
   ```
   [Jitterbug Route] Processing logs: [...]
   [Jitterbug Route] Received logs: [...]
   ```
3. Missing Critical Info:
   - Which SSE transport implementation is being used (13/14/15)
   - Whether EventSource or fetch+ReadableStream is active
   - Connection state transitions
   - Stream health metrics

## Implementation Notes
1. Route Handler:
   - Successfully detecting SSE requests
   - Creating streams correctly
   - Processing logs as expected
   - Need to add transport path logging

2. SSE Transports:
   - Need to add version-specific logging
   - Should log connection method used
   - Should track connection state changes
   - Need stream health monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Add detailed transport logging:
   ```typescript
   console.log('[Jitterbug SSE] Using Next.js ${version} transport');
   console.log('[Jitterbug SSE] Connection method: ${method}');
   console.log('[Jitterbug SSE] Stream type: ${streamType}');
   ```
2. Implement connection state logging:
   - Connection attempts
   - Successful connections
   - Disconnections
   - Reconnection attempts
3. Add stream health metrics:
   - Message throughput
   - Connection duration
   - Reconnection frequency

## Environment Context
- Next.js: 15.1.6
- Node.js: 22
- React: 18.2.0
- Runtime: Edge

## Recent Changes Timeline
1. Fixed route handler method signatures
2. Implemented consistent transport error handling
3. Added proper type safety for log entries
4. Updated version detection logging
5. Fixed access modifiers across transports
6. Identified missing transport path logging

## Long-term Improvements
1. Expose connection metrics for monitoring
2. Add support for custom serialization
3. Consider implementing backpressure handling
4. Add support for binary message formats
5. Implement comprehensive transport logging
