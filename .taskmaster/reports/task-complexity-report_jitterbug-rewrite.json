		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Core Orchestrator Module",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CoreOrchestrator implementation into modular components: 1) Core orchestrator class structure with dependency injection, 2) Branch registry system with lifecycle management, 3) Intelligent routing and delegation logic, 4) Inter-branch pub/sub communication system, 5) Runtime configuration management, 6) Error boundary and resilience patterns",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex architectural component requiring careful design of multiple subsystems. The orchestrator needs sophisticated routing logic, state management, pub/sub implementation, and must avoid circular dependencies while maintaining extensibility. Each recommended subtask represents a distinct architectural concern that requires focused implementation."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Browser Console API with window.jitterbug Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the browser console API implementation into: 1) Global window.jitterbug object initialization with early error capture, 2) Branch management API methods (create, list, remove), 3) Debug control methods (enable/disable, log levels), 4) Configuration persistence with localStorage, 5) Utility and introspection methods with help system",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task involves multiple API surface areas, early initialization challenges, localStorage integration, and proper error handling. The API needs to be discoverable and user-friendly while maintaining robust integration with the orchestrator."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Beautiful Emoji Console Transport with Expandable Details",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the console transport implementation as: 1) Core transport class with orchestrator integration, 2) Formatting engine with emoji indicators and CSS styling, 3) Console grouping logic with smart expansion rules, 4) Cross-browser compatibility and fallback handling",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a presentation layer task with moderate complexity. The main challenges are cross-browser compatibility, console API variations, and creating an intuitive grouping/expansion experience. The integration points are well-defined through the orchestrator pattern."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SSE (Server-Sent Events) Transport for Unified Client/Server Log Streaming",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the SSE transport system in phases: 1) Client-side SSE connection manager with reconnection logic, 2) Server-side SSE endpoint with connection pooling, 3) Bidirectional log flow with HTTP POST for client->server, 4) Log aggregation and filtering system, 5) Authentication and authorization layer, 6) Performance optimizations (compression, batching), 7) Error handling and graceful degradation",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task, involving both client and server components, real-time communication, connection management, security considerations, and performance optimization. The bidirectional nature and need for reliability across network conditions significantly increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Next.js Integration Package with App Router Support",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build the Next.js package incrementally: 1) Package structure with TypeScript configuration and exports, 2) React client component for log viewing with filtering UI, 3) App Router API route handlers for SSE endpoints, 4) Setup utilities and documentation for easy integration",
			"reasoning": "This task requires knowledge of Next.js packaging conventions, both routing paradigms, React component patterns, and TypeScript. The complexity is moderate as it primarily involves integrating existing functionality into Next.js patterns rather than implementing new core features."
