# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement SSE (Server-Sent Events) Transport for Unified Client/Server Log Streaming
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a real-time log streaming system using Server-Sent Events that enables bidirectional flow where client logs are sent to server and all logs are streamed back via SSE for unified viewing across environments.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive SSE transport system with both client and server components. On the client side, create an SSE client that connects to the server endpoint and receives real-time log streams, while also providing methods to send client-side logs to the server via HTTP POST. Build a server-side SSE endpoint that maintains persistent connections with clients and broadcasts log events in real-time. Implement a log aggregation system that collects logs from multiple sources (client-side errors, server-side events, API calls, etc.) and streams them through the SSE connection. Create connection management with automatic reconnection logic, heartbeat mechanisms, and graceful degradation when SSE is unavailable. Design the transport to integrate seamlessly with the orchestrator pattern, allowing different debug branches to stream their logs through the SSE connection. Implement filtering and routing capabilities so clients can subscribe to specific log types or branches. Add authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized clients can access log streams. Include compression and batching for efficient data transfer, and implement proper error handling for connection failures and network issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test SSE connection establishment and persistence across different browsers and network conditions. Verify bidirectional log flow by sending client logs to server and confirming they appear in the SSE stream. Test automatic reconnection behavior when connections are lost or interrupted. Validate that multiple clients can connect simultaneously and receive independent log streams. Test log filtering and branch-specific subscriptions work correctly. Verify authentication prevents unauthorized access to log streams. Test performance with high-volume log streaming and ensure no memory leaks occur during extended sessions. Validate graceful degradation when SSE is not supported or network conditions are poor. Test integration with the orchestrator system to ensure all debug branches can stream through SSE. Verify compression and batching optimize network usage without introducing significant latency.
