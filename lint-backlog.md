## P0: Critical Prerequisites

### Edge Boundary Layer (EBL) Implementation

#### Progress Update [2024-02-02 22:45]
- Simplified core.ts to focus on essential functionality
- Added serialization-safe types for client-server boundary
- Implemented basic error reporting structure
- Removed overengineered validation system

##### EBL1: Core Validation Layer (Large) [ðŸŸ¡ In Progress]
Context: Foundation for type validation and boundary management
Location: src/types/ebl/core.ts
- [x] Implement basic EdgeBoundaryLayer interface (1h)
- [x] Add error reporting structure (1h)
- [x] Add Sentry integration hook (0.5h)
- [ ] Set up telemetry hooks (remaining)
Progress: ~60% complete
Memory Impact: Reduced from Critical to Medium

##### EBL2: Memory Management (Medium) [âœ… Simplified]
Context: Memory management approach simplified
- [x] Removed complex caching system
- [x] Simplified memory management
- [x] Removed unnecessary cleanup strategies
Note: Complexity reduced by removing WeakMap caching

##### EBL3: Runtime Guards (Medium) [ðŸŸ¡ In Progress]
Context: Edge and SSR specific type guards
Location: src/types/index.ts
- [x] Add serialization-safe types
- [x] Implement type guards for serialized logs
- [ ] Add edge runtime guards
Progress: ~40% complete

Implementation Strategy Updated:
1. Focus on minimal viable implementation
2. Avoid premature optimization
3. Keep type boundaries clear
4. Maintain Edge runtime compatibility

Next Steps:
1. Complete basic telemetry implementation
2. Add remaining edge runtime guards
3. Test serialization safety
4. Document simplified approach

Memory Impact Notes:
- Removed WeakMap caching complexity
- Simplified type validation approach
- Reduced memory footprint
- Clearer type boundaries
