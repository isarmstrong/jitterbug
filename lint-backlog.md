# Lint Resolution Backlog

## Overview
Total Active Errors: 172
Status: ðŸŸ¡ Warning (majority due to ESLint/TSConfig misconfigurations)

## Implementation Context
- AI Agent: Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for type system analysis and implementation
- Previous Attempts: Tried direct type mapping (failed due to memory constraints)
- Memory Management: WeakMap-based caching required for validation results
- Edge Runtime: Must consider Next.js 13+ edge runtime constraints
- React Version: Locked to React 18.2 with Next.js 15
- Node Version: Running on Node.js 22

## Previous Decisions
1. [2024-02-02 16:45] Attempted direct type mapping approach
   - Result: Failed due to memory constraints in edge runtime
   - Learning: Need WeakMap-based caching strategy
2. [2024-02-02 16:50] Tried parallel validation strategy
   - Result: Caused race conditions in SSR
   - Learning: Must use sequential validation in SSR context
3. [2024-02-02 16:56] Implemented Edge Boundary Layer concept
   - Result: Successfully reduced memory footprint
   - Next Steps: Full implementation across all pools

## Phase 5: Production Hardening
Status: ðŸ”´ Not Started
Priority: P0 (Required before first production release)

### Training Wheels Removal
Problem:
- Development conveniences may mask production issues
- Edge runtime compatibility needs verification
- Memory patterns need production validation

Tasks:
1. [ ] Audit and remove dev-only imports
   - Verify all imports work in edge runtime
   - Document required production import paths
   - Test memory impact of import patterns

2. [ ] Edge Runtime Boundary Verification
   - Validate all EBL components in edge context
   - Test memory limits in production builds
   - Verify SSR hydration patterns

3. [ ] Production Build Artifact Validation
   - Create CI checks for edge compatibility
   - Verify bundle size and tree-shaking
   - Test memory cleanup in long-running edge contexts

4. [ ] Migration Guide for Consumers
   - Document production setup requirements
   - List known edge runtime gotchas
   - Provide memory management guidelines

Notes:
- This phase addresses technical debt from earlier pool resolutions
- Focus on production readiness and edge runtime stability
- Required before package can be used in production apps

## P0: Critical Prerequisites
These items MUST be completed before pool-based resolution can begin.

### Edge Boundary Layer (EBL) Implementation
Problem:
- Current type system lacks clear validation boundaries
- Memory management is inefficient
- No standardized approach for edge runtime validation
- Type safety gaps between core and branch types

Analysis:
- [x] WeakMap caching needed for validation results
